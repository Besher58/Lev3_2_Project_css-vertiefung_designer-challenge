            </h1>
            <p class="mainP fontWeight">Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design
                skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had
                only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes
                more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
                interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did
                not solve any problem.</p>
            <h1 class="self">After several weeks of sticking to this challenge, I learned a lot</h1>
